## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1
1. In this case, RwLock<> is used because it provides flexibility for programs with many threads to read data simultaneously, but only allows one thread to write at any given time. This is highly effective because the read process in this case is more frequent than the write process. Mutex<> is not used because it only allows one thread to access a piece of data. Therefore, in this case, Mutex<> is not used because the Notifications vector will be read by many threads.
2. In Rust, static variables differ from Java, especially regarding mutability. Static variables in Rust must be thread-safe (cannot be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously) and immutable. This is to prevent race conditions. To overcome this limitation, lazy_static is used in Rust. lazy_static allows the definition of mutable static variables safely, like Mutexed or RwLock, which manage access to these variables, thus enabling safe mutation in multithreading. Therefore, lazy_static provides a way for static variables that are "similar" to those in Java, but with safe handling according to Rust's concurrency model.

#### Reflection Subscriber-2
1. Done, in my opinion, examples like src/lib.rs contain necessary information where elements for the application are defined. For instance, in this tutorial, src/lib.rs contains error management by setting Error as the default error for the Result type (as error handling), and there is also ErrorResponse which contains error response along with status code and message.
2. In this tutorial, the process of adding a subscriber is by adding a new subscriber to the list of observers. So, when a new subscriber subscribes, it will be added to the list of observers. If there is a case like the one mentioned in the question, where an instance of the Main app is spawned, there will be no problem because it just needs to adjust the process of registering subscribers to the appropriate API.
3. Done, in my opinion, testing with Postman collection is quite easy and helpful. We can adjust the data we send during the HTTP request and then ensure whether the response our program should provide is correct or not. This is very helpful because we can check certain APIs without using real data from the respective application/program.
